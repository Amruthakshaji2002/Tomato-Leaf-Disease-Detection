# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection  

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for detecting tomato leaf diseases such as *Bacterial Spot* and *Early Blight*.  
This project applies deep learning techniques to support sustainable agriculture by enabling early and accurate disease detection.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Tomatoes are one of the most widely cultivated crops but are highly vulnerable to diseases, leading to major yield losses.  
Traditional inspection methods are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone.  
This project leverages **image processing + CNNs** to automatically classify tomato leaf diseases, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a CNN model to identify and classify tomato leaf diseases.  
- Compare performance across multiple training epochs (5, 10, 15).  
- Provide an automated and efficient detection system for farmers.
